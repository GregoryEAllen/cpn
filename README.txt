This is a Mercurial repository.

Mercurial: a fast, lightweight Source Control Management system designed for
efficient handling of very large distributed projects.

The command-line utility for Mercurial is "hg".

On machines mounting /v/repositories, you should be able to check out with:
$ hg clone /v/repositories/cpn

Otherwise:
$ hg clone ssh://gallen@syrinx//v/repositories/cpn

(Any machine with hg installed will work in place of syrinx.)
