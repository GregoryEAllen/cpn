To build the unit tests cppunit must be installed and pkg-config must know how
to get its compiler flags.  All the tests are in the test directory.  All tests
dealing with the CPN library are in cpntest. Some of the other libraries have a test directory.
To build the xmlcpntest requires libxml++.

Seive of Eratosthenes

There are two versions of this the first is called SimpleSieve and the second
is called ThresholdSieve.  To run these go either
SieveOfEratosthenes/SimpleSeive or /ThresholdSieve and execute jmake. Then run
the resulting executable with the -h option to get specific options.

Random Instruction

There are two ways to run the random instruction test.
The first is all in one process. Go to RandomInstruction and jmake.
Then run with -h to get a list of options.

The second one is on multiple processes and requires more setup.
First build RemoteRandomInstruction then build RemoteDatabase.
Then create a config file for the RemoteRandomInstruction (the -h
option prints out a description of what the config is supposed to look like
as well there is an example in that directory).
Now run the RemoteDatabase with the listening host and port set in the config.
Then run each of the RemoteRandomInstruction with parameters of config then
the name.

For the given example config it would be:
Run on zeus: RemoteDatabase zeus 12345
Run: RemoteRandomInstruction configk2n100i100 kone
Run: RemoteRandomInstruction configk2n100i100 ktwo
